1. For perl users
1.1. dependencies
Perl version v5.21.1 or above with modules POSIX, Data::Dump, Exporter, List::Util (install these modules with e.g. cpanm).
1.2. usage
Change the data $a_in, $a_R or $c, etc. as necessary in the file "sample.pl"

2. For python users
2.1. dependencies
Perl version v5.21.1 or above with modules POSIX, Data::Dump, Exporter, List::Util, lib (install these modules with e.g. cpanm) in addition to Python version either 2 or 3 with python modules re, subprocess.
2.2. usage
Change the data in the file "sample.py" as necessary. Note that the python script invokes the perl libraries "lib/QEDC.pm" via "lib/QEDC_py.pl" essentially and is thus slower than "sample.pl", which directly calls "lib/QEDC.pm".
