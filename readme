1. For perl users
Change the data $a_in, $a_R or $c, etc. as necessary in the file "sample.pl"

2. For python users
Change the data in the file "sample.py" as necessary. Note that the python script invokes the perl libraries "lib/QEDC.pm" via "lib/QEDC_py.pl" essentially and is thus slower than "sample.pl", which directly calls "lib/QEDC.pm".
